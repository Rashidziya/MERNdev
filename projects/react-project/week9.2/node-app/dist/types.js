"use strict";
// Very similar to interfaces , types let you aggregate data together.
// but interfaces can be implemented by class where as type cannot
// Ex:-
// type persons={
//     name:string,
//     age:number,
//     email?:string
// }
// popular interview question 
// How types and interfaces are differ 
//1.> interfaces can be implemented by class and types cannot
//2.> when you a thing could be of multiple types like id= string|number
//3.> and when you know a thing would be the intersection of two things 
//    by using & operator between two variables
