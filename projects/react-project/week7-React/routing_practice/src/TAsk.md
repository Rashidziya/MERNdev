## Create a multiple page webApp 
- Where User can Switch between Pages:- 
    It Should Support the Client side Routing 
        * which means that "ki" Whenever a user go to webApp landing route.
          All the html,css and js All gets rendered in user browser at one time only.
          It means "ki" whenever user is switching between the pages/components/routes
          THey are Somehow done locally.it doesn't like the other request is going to 
          backend to load the partiular Routes.It someHow Done within the user's browser 
          itself.

          This is Achieved through react.React sends a large js file as a "Bundle" 
          to the user's browser. 

- I have implemented the .location to change the Routes whenever particular route go hit
