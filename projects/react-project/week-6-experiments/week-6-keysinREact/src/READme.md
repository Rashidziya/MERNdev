## create a simple Todo appliction
- it will have 3 Todos
- A button At the top to Add the Todos
- Iterate Over the Todos and Render it in the DoM

-After doing all there is error/warning is appearing in console
    which means that there should must have unique for each element in the list
    React wants that if there is list of data .then there should be unique keys 
    for each elements.and it should be send as a props at the time of rendering of component.That's all because REact can understand that which list of elements is 
    updated,removed,inserted on the basis of "keys".
