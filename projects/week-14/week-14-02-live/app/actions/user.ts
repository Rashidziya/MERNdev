"use server"

// here to implement the logic/function to implement server actions
// Server Actions :- It contains the function that simply can be accessed by both 
// server and client component. like if we want a generic fucntion which fetches some 
// kind of data from the DB. and it is needed in both server  and client. component then
// in those cases we can make a generic function using "server actions" which can then 
// be easily accesible from client and server component as function() call.

// get Full understanding and then implement here.
