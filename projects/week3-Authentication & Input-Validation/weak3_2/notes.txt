 This lecture is about Dynamic Backend Authentication using Express,JWT
 and mongodb.


Dynamic Backend Authentication uses 4 concepts..

1.> Hashing -> It is one way. 
    ex:- facebook takes email and password as data to sign in.
    
    This Authentication method takes the input and before storing it to the 
    some Backend database it converts it to some jebrish(string).which cant 
    be decrypted so the data is safe.

    when the user with the same input tries to login again it 
    basically converts the password to jebrish(string) then matches it with
    the Backend(jebrish(string)).if it is the same then it lets user sign in
    other wise throw error.
